...!!! 
You did it! Thank you for helping us!!!
Whatever evil kept the Fire Crystal from working is now gone! 
To the north, the Wind Crystal seems to have suffered the same fate.
Sandstorms have been plaguing the village bordering the desert. 
I hate to trouble you but those plants of yours are mighty effective! 
Help bring balance to the Endless Sands and we will be forever in your debt.
