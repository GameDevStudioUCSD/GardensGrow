Truly, you are capable of much more than I had thought.
Your bravery gives the people of Gardenia hope!
You have already done much but still a crystal is left; the Earth Crystal trapped in the Haunted Grotto.
I would not ask but your strength and courage makes you the only one capable of freeing it.
Please go to the west and defeat the evil that is plaguing us.
