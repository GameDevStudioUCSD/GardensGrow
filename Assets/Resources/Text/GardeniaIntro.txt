Hi!
You must be the new neighbor!
Welcome to Gardenia!
Look, uhh… I know we’ve just met, but I see you’ve got a shovel with
you.
My house is under attack by some Fire Slimes.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could help smother them out for
me.
Simply use [W], [A], [S], [D] to move, and [Space] to use your shovel.
My house is right near the entrance of Meadowland.
Thanks!
