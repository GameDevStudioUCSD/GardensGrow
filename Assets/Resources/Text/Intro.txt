Welcome neighbor!
Strange you decided to move here with all the horrible monsters and all.
Ever since something infected the Wistful Willow, things have been thrown into chaos.
I guess thatâ€™s what made your house so cheap though huh?
If only someone was brave enough to fight back...
...Oh well! Good luck with those Fire Slimes coming from Meadowland to the east!
They are a real pain.
