You know, these monsters haven’t always attacked us.
In Gardenia, each of its four biomes is protected by a spirit deep underground.
However, I fear that Meadowland’s spirit has left us.
I’ve been meaning to check on the Meadowland Shrine one of these days, but unfortunately I heard that it’s been overrun by monsters!
…and lava!
If only there’s some way to fight them back, I would go in a heartbeat!
