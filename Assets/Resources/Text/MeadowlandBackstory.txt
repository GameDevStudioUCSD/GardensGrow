Wow you destroyed the Fire Slimes with ease!
Maybe you could be the one to help save Gardenia...
Those Fire Slimes are a result of the volcano erupting.
The Fire Crystal was keeping the volcano dormant but not anymore.
If you can find out what happened to the crystal, you should be able to save the forest!
